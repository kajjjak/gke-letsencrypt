# Deploy a sample web app on a domain name

A brief copy of the [GKE static IP tutorial][tut] is below.

First, deploy the [sample web application manifest](yaml/sample-app.yaml) which
contains the Deployment and a NodePort Service (required by Ingress):

    kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kajjjak/gke-letsencrypt/master/yaml/sample-app.yaml

Create a static IP called to (will be used in the Ingress):

    gcloud compute addresses create helloweb-ip --global

Then, deploy the Ingress using [this manifest](yaml/sample-ingress.yaml):

    kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kajjjak/gke-letsencrypt/master/yaml/sample-ingress.yaml

Run `kubectl get ingress` until you see the static IP address assigned to the
load balancer.

Visit this IP address on your browser.

:warning: **Wait until visiting the IP address works:** The Google HTTP
Load Balancer can take 5-10 minutes; during that time you'll see 404s, and other
server errors. Do not panic, be patient!

After it works, **update your domain name records** (at your domain registrar or DNS
provider) with this IP address.

**Verify the domain name works** in your browser before proceeding &mdash;use
`http://`, as we don't have `https://` yet.
